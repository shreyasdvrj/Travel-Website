Great experience hiring a car from Hop'On, we were met at arrivals by a helpful rep,the handover was painless and the car was all as expected. When we dropped it off there was a cursory glance over the car, just asked us if we'd had any problems, which we hadn't, so all in all a very easy and efficient experience
